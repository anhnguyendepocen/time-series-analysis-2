Repository for self study on Jonathan, D. Cryer, and Chan Kung-Sik. "Time series analysis with applications in R." SpringerLink, Springer eBooks (2008).

Exercises are conducted on both R and Python for language practice purposes. 

- Regression diagnostic graphs, in the same style as R, are implemented in `Python/utils.py`.
- EACF is reimplemented in Python in `Python/eacf.py`.  Note that it uses statsmodels' ACF, rather than R, which may lead to small numerical computation differences.
